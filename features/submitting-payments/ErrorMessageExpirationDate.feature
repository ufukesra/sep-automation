Feature: Error messages for the invalid expiration number

    As a user, I want to be informed when my card's expiration date has failed. 


    #* AC1: 1. An immediate error message should be thrown if the expiration number is too short or wrong:
    #*                  Your card's expiration date is incomplete.
    #*                  Your card's expiration year is in the past.
