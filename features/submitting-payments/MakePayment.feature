Feature: Make a payment

    As a customer, I should be able to make payments so I can enroll in the program.

    #*      and clicks on the Pay button, then they should be redirected to the confirmation page.

    #* AC2: In the stepper, steps 1, 2, 3 should be green.
    #* AC3: The correct program name should be displayed.
    #* AC4: The correct user email should be displayed.
