Feature: Error message for the invalid CVC number

    As a user, I want to be informed when the CVC number I enter is incorrect or too short.

    #* AC1: The Immediate error message should be thrown if the CVC number is too short or wrong. "Your card's security code is incomplete."


    #TODO: Create scenarios that cover all the acceptance criteria
