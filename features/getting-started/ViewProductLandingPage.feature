Feature: View Product Landing Page

    As a customer, I should be able to see the product landing page.

    #* AC1: The system displays the text "Cydeo Secure Checkout".
    #* AC2: The system should display the program name.
    #* AC3: Users should see a footer on the left side of the page that includes by order: 
    #*      logo, Terms and Conditions, Privacy Policy, Disclaimer, Cookie Policy
    
    #* AC4: The system displays "Need help? Contact us at enrollment@cydeo.com" in the footer on the right.
    #* AC5: The system should be compatible with both desktop and mobile devices.
